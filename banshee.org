  - [X] Pull in STL
  - [X] Establish communication mechanism between host and renderer
    - Connect, Terminate, NewSurface
  - [X] Using ancillary data mechanism of Unix sockets, transfer over GraphicBuffer
    object
  - [X] Switch to UDP sockets
  - [ ] Setup a native activity with gles2 initialization
  - [ ] Have the host ask for a frame from the renderer, draw something from the
    renderer, then have the host draw it as a texture to the window
  - [ ] Switch away from GraphicBuffer, due to the private declarations. Instead
    directly use GraphicBufferAllocator and GraphicBufferMapper.
